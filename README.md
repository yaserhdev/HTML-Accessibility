# HTML-Accessibility
Week 1 Challenge

These are the files to the webpage of Horiseon. I've made the webpage more accessible by making the following changes:

- adding semantic HTML elements

- adding alt attributes for images and icons

- adding a descriptive title

- structuring HTML elements in a logical and sequential order
